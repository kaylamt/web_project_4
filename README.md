# Practicum by Yandex Web Project

## Description

This project builds an interactive webpage displaying locations in America. This adaptive webiste allows users to change their profile information using an edit button and a popup form. Users can also add and delete cards using the New Card form and delete button attached to each card. This project added even more js files with different classes. The code is then imported from the respective js files into index.js. This page is now connected to the server along with other students' projects. Images from various projects can now be viewed & liked. Users can now edit their profile picture, and their profile name will be saved to the server.

## Technologies & Techniuques

This webpage uses Javascript along with CSS to create a popup form field that allows users to change and save their profile name and description. This was accomplished using addEventListener(). This site also uses grid layout to create a grid block for the user's images. Reactive properties were used to make the elements responsive to different screen sizes, such as calc() and max-width. Initial cards were loaded to the page using JS. 5 new classes were added to the code, including the Section class which renders data on the page. The project is built using WebPack. APIs are used to GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE information to the server.
