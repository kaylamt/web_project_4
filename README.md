# Practicum by Yandex Web Project

## Description

This project builds an interactive webpage displaying locations in America. This adaptive webiste allows users to change their profile information using an edit button and a popup form. Users can also add and delete cards using the New Card form and delete button attached to each card. This project added input validation on the profile and add button forms. There is now a character limit set to each field, and if users do not fill out the form properly the submit button is disabled and an alert will appear.

## Technologies & Techniuques

This webpage uses Javascript along with CSS to create a popup form field that allows users to change and save their profile name and description. This was accomplished using addEventListener(). This site also uses grid layout to create a grid block for the user's images. Reactive properties were used to make the elements responsive to different screen sizes, such as calc() and max-width. Initial cards were loaded to the page using JS. New functions were added to add and remove cards in JS. The new project uses an enableValidation() function to test each input for correct values.
