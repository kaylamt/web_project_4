# Practicum by Yandex Web Project

## Description

This project builds an interactive webpage displaying locations in America. This adaptive webiste allows users to change their profile information using an edit button and a popup form. Users can also add and delete cards using the New Card form and delete button attached to each card.

## Technologies & Techniuques

This webpage uses Javascript along with CSS to create a popup form field that allows users to change and save their profile name and description. This was accomplished using addEventListener(). This site also uses grid layout to create a grid block for the user's images. Reactive properties were used to make the elements responsive to different screen sizes, such as calc() and max-width. Initial cards were loaded to the page using JS. New functions were added to add and remove cards in JS.
